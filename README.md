# Cash Machine - Sample Project with VueJs, NodeJs and ChaiJs

This project is divided into 2:
 * FrontEnd
 * BackEnd

With small simple tests for the BackEnd.

## Getting Started

* Clone [cash-machine-clone](https://github.com/daniasalli/cash-machine.git)
OR
* Download [cash-machine-Download](https://github.com/daniasalli/cash-machine/archive/master.zip)

There are 2 folders in the root directory. One for each project ([FrontEnd](https://github.com/daniasalli/cash-machine/tree/master/cashMachineUI) and [BackEnd](https://github.com/daniasalli/cash-machine/tree/master/cashMachineApi))

Using the console, go to each directory and 
install dependencies for each project using
```console
npm install
```

Then, still using the console, go the BackEnd directory,
run the tests to validate it is working and
start the server using:
```console
npm test
node server.js
```

Finally open another console and go to the FrontEnd directory,
start the server using:
```console
npm run serve
```

FrontEnd runs on port 8080
BackEnd runs on port 3000

Once both projects are up and running
go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you'll be able to play with the cash machine.
